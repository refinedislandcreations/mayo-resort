    North Bali is the laid-back, peaceful, and uncommercialised part of the island—reminiscent of what the south used to be like 20 or 30 years ago. With only one-sixth of Bali’s population but a coastline stretching over 200 km, traffic jams and crowds are rare. The scenery is stunning, the air is fresh, and the people are warm and welcoming. <br> <br>
    This is a region where nature and culture thrive in harmony. Crater lakes, waterfalls, hot springs, rice terraces, coral-fringed beaches, and some of Southeast Asia’s most iconic diving spots—North Bali offers a more authentic, untouched experience of the island. You’ll also find rich cultural heritage, from ancient temples to colonial architecture in Singaraja, and the vibrant charm of Lovina, the north’s tourism hub. <br> <br>
    Though it remains relatively unchanged, transformation is on the horizon. A new airport and improved infrastructure are planned, making now the perfect time to explore North Bali before the world catches on.
