    Whether you’re here for a leisurely lunch, early evening sundowners, or a relaxed dinner, Restaurant Bora Bora offers one of the most desired settings in all of North Bali. <br> <br>
    The gentle rumble of the waves will relax you, balmy sea breezes provide natural air-conditioning, and the ample shade keeps you cool and comfortable all day long. <br> <br>
    For hotel guests, it’s the perfect place to unwind, socialize with friends, play games, or simply lounge and read. Prefer the pool? We’ll deliver drinks and light meals directly poolside. <br> <br>
    Restaurant Bora Bora is also an ideal destination for private functions and celebrations. Special menus can be tailored to your requirements—whether it’s for 2 people or 32, Balinese or international. <br> <br>
    Nothing is too much trouble for us.
