  description: >
    Only 100 km from Kuta and Seminyak… yet it feels like a million miles away. <br> <br>
    Mayo Resort is located 4 km from Seririt, right at the junction of Bali’s north coast highway and two main north–south routes, making us one of the most easily accessible resorts in North Bali. <br> <br>
    Distance from Ngurah Rai International Airport: 110 km Journey time: 3–3.5 hours From Ubud: 90 km, around 2.5 hours <br> <br>
    Once you leave the bustle of the south and pass the temple town of Mengwi, the roads open up, traffic eases, and the scenery turns spectacular. We recommend taking your time — traveling here is part of the North Bali experience. There’s so much to see on the way, we’ve put together three scenic route options with our favourite stops along the way.
